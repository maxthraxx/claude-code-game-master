━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  GENERATING YOUR WORLD
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Campaign: "<CAMPAIGN_NAME>"
Tone: <TONE> | Magic: <MAGIC_LEVEL> | Setting: <SETTING_TYPE>

Building your world...

  ├─ Creating starting location.... [working]
  ├─ Populating with NPCs.......... [working]
  ├─ Weaving plot threads.......... [working]
  └─ Establishing connections...... [working]
```

### Generate Starting Location

Based on the setting type, create the starting location with full detail:
- 100+ word description with sensory details
- 3+ named NPCs with personalities
- Connections to adjacent areas
- Local secrets and current events

```bash
bash tools/dm-location.sh add "[Starting Location Name]" "center of the settlement"
bash tools/dm-location.sh describe "[Starting Location Name]" "[detailed description]"
```

### Generate Supporting Locations

Create 3-4 connected locations with moderate detail (50-80 words each):
- A place for services/commerce
- A place for authority/knowledge
- A place representing danger or mystery

```bash
bash tools/dm-location.sh add "[Location Name]" "[position relative to start]"
bash tools/dm-location.sh connect "[Start]" "[Location]" "[path description]"
```

### Generate NPCs

Create 6 interconnected NPCs:
1. **Quest Giver A** - Has a problem to solve
2. **Quest Giver B** - Rival with conflicting goals
3. **Service Provider** - Merchant or craftsperson
4. **Information Source** - Knows local secrets
5. **Mysterious Figure** - Hints at larger plots
6. **Local Character** - Adds flavor and humor

```bash
bash tools/dm-npc.sh create "[Name]" "[description]" "[attitude]"
bash tools/dm-npc.sh tag-location "[Name]" "[location]"
```

### Generate Plot Hooks

Create three interconnected storylines:

**Local Conflict** (1-3 sessions)
- Affects starting location directly
- Can be partially resolved quickly

**Regional Mystery** (4-8 sessions)
- Spans multiple locations
- Requires investigation

**World Event** (campaign-long)
- Background threat building
- Only hints initially

```bash
bash tools/dm-note.sh "plot_local" "[local conflict description]"
bash tools/dm-note.sh "plot_regional" "[regional mystery description]"
bash tools/dm-note.sh "plot_world" "[world event hints]"
```

### Schedule Consequences

Plant future events:

```bash
bash tools/dm-consequence.sh add "[Hook to draw players in]" "next session"
bash tools/dm-consequence.sh add "[Strange event occurs]" "2 days"
bash tools/dm-consequence.sh add "[Rumor arrives from afar]" "1 week"
```

### Update Status

As each element completes:
```
  ├─ Creating starting location.... done
  ├─ Populating with NPCs.......... done (6 characters)
  ├─ Weaving plot threads.......... done (3 storylines)
  └─ Establishing connections...... done
```

## PHASE 6: UPDATE CAMPAIGN OVERVIEW

```bash
CAMPAIGN_DIR=$(bash tools/dm-campaign.sh path)

uv run python -c "

from datetime import datetime

# Load existing campaign overview
with open('$CAMPAIGN_DIR/campaign-overview.json', 'r') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

data.update({
    'current_date': '1st day of Springrise, Year 1000',
    'time_of_day': 'Morning',
    'player_position': {
        'current_location': '[Starting location name]',

    },

    'session_count': 0
})

with open('$CAMPAIGN_DIR/campaign-overview.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(data, f, indent=2)
"
```

---

## PHASE 7: INITIALIZE SESSION LOG

```bash
CAMPAIGN_DIR=$(bash tools/dm-campaign.sh path)
cat > "$CAMPAIGN_DIR/session-log.md" << EOF
# Session Log - [CAMPAIGN_NAME]

**Tone**: [TONE]
**Magic Level**: [MAGIC_LEVEL]
